If you want to buy a low cost kimsufi, this software can help you :)

OVHKimsufiBuyer ask every 'n' seconds if the server you want is available.
And when the dream comes true, it will open a new tab in your web-browser, simulating the click on the purchase button.

BUT

be aware that this software has been written in couples of minutes...


All you need to know is the reference of the server you want.
The program will use this url to have infos about availability:

https://ws.ovh.com/dedicated/r2/ws.dispatcher/getAvailability2?callback=Request.JSONP.request_map.request_0


You can easly find the reference by "right-click + inspecting element" when you are on the server list on the server you want:

https://www.kimsufi.com/fr/serveurs.xml


Be brave, and good luck!
